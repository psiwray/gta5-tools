# GTA5 Tools

This tool is a simple executable that listens for hot-keys, more specifically
for Ctrl+Alt+F6 and Ctrl+Alt+F7 while you're in game to respectively disconnect
and reconnect the selected network adapter or freeze the game for some seconds.

The settings are saved on disk and are created new if the file isn't originally
found the first time.

The executable can be kept active while gaming so that it's not necessary to
manually change windows while in the game.
