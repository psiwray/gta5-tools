# GTA5 Tools

This tool is a simple executable that listens for hot-keys, more specifically
for `Ctrl+Alt+F6` and `Ctrl+Alt+F7` while you're in game to respectively
disconnect and reconnect the selected network adapter or freeze the game for
some seconds. The settings are saved on disk in the `config.json` file and are
created new if the file isn't originally found the first time.

The executable can be kept active while gaming so that it's not necessary to
manually change windows while in the game. It requires .NET 5 to be installed
for it to work.
